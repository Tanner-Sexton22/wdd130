      <h3>[Why Come to my online store?]</h3>
      <p>
        [People will come to my sight to look at and buy a variety of products that I have. My family has a huge collection of different collectible items that are from the 1960s to now. Those include baseball, basketball, football, Pokémon, yugiho, bakugon, magic, and even more cards. There is also marvel, Zelda, and many other types of retro comics. My dad even has some toys and other things. Most of these are unopened and sealed. [Several are open but professionally graded. How that works is when you open a sports or trading card and its a rare one, if it is in good condition, (which means it has no creases, no scratches on it, anything like that), you can pay money to ship it to a professional grading company. That company, (there are a few different ones, the most notable being PSA), will then take a few days and give the card a number out of 10 grading, depending on the condition of your card. It has to be pretty much perfect for it to get an 8, 9, or somehow a 10. Most of the cards we got graded are 6,7 and 8. 

 

        An example of one, we have one Michael Jordan bulls' card that is an 8/10. It is worth a few thousand dollars. It's pretty incredible when you think about how little pieces of paper with designs on them can be worth so much money, just because someone says so or thinks it is cool. What a time we live in! I also have thousands of Pokémon cards and ones similar to those. Pokémon is a big brand, and there are many cards that we could get graded as well and make good money off of.]

      </ul>
      <h3>[Where do i find what im looking for?]</h3>
      <p>
        [The questions that people could have when coming on my site would be: where can I find this card? Do you have this comic? How much is this certain item? And other questions like that. The activities visitors will want to complete on my sight really just come down to which page they go to, and what they want to look at and potentially buy from there. The only information that is necessary to complete actions on my site is to know how to get to another page, and how to add something to a cart and checkout with it. Nothing crazy, I am hoping to keep it really simple.  

        Why my site? 
        
        People are going to come to my site instead of others because I am going to have sooo much inventory, and quality pictures as well. I am going to have my parents ship everything out from my house in Tennessee and provide excellent service.  
        
        Challanges 
        
        The biggest challenge I am going to face is having people be able to find my website. I don’t really know how I am going to do that yet, but I have a good idea. In my online business creation class, I am learning about how to run google ads, and other things like that. I think that will really help more traction go to my website. I will also probably be posting in Facebook and other social media groups to see if people would reach me that way. It will be hard to gain traction at first, but I think with a lot of hard work and good quality photos it can be done.  
        
        Another challenge will be taking pictures of tons and tons of stuff and putting them all on the website. It will be very time-consuming and tedious. It will also make a huge mess in our storage room in our basement at my parents' house! But thankfully I may not have to deal with that unless I am home for the summer.  ]
