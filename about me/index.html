    <h2> Tanner Sexton </h2>
    <p> Hey guys! I am from Knoxville Tennessee. Its amazing there, its green, blue skies, lots of lakes/pools, bible belt,etc. I love everything about it. I love my family and friends. I am a triplet and an identical twin at the same time. pretty crazy huh? My dad is a convert to the church so that is special to me. I want to be his partner in his law firm back in tennessee after college and law school. I will use my business degree to learn vauleble skills to help sustain the practice. I love lifting weights, playing sports, going on the lake, and anything fun to be honest. I got married a few months ago and am loving life. </p>
